Fungi with a bright yellow or orange color, characteristic of the Maritime Sunburst Lichen.
Fungi with a circular, sunburst-like pattern, hence the name "Sunburst Lichen".
Fungi with a crustose growth form, meaning it grows tightly attached to its substrate.
Fungi with a thallus (the body of a lichen) that is flat and spread out, often forming rosette patterns.
Fungi with a granular or areolate (cracked like dried mud) surface texture.
Fungi that are found growing on maritime rocks, a typical habitat for the Maritime Sunburst Lichen.
Fungi that are found in coastal areas, especially those with salty air, as the Maritime Sunburst Lichen thrives in such environments.
Fungi with apothecia (the fruiting bodies of lichen) that are small, round, and often the same color as the thallus.
Fungi that are found in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in North America and Europe, where the Maritime Sunburst Lichen is common.
Fungi with a diameter typically ranging from 1 to 3 cm, a common size for the Maritime Sunburst Lichen.
Fungi that are found on both acidic and basic rocks, as the Maritime Sunburst Lichen is not particular about the pH of its substrate.
Fungi that are found in areas with high exposure to sunlight, as the Maritime Sunburst Lichen prefers such conditions.
Fungi with a lack of soredia or isidia (reproductive structures in lichens), which are not present in the Maritime Sunburst Lichen.
Fungi that are found in areas with high rainfall, as the Maritime Sunburst Lichen prefers moist environments.
