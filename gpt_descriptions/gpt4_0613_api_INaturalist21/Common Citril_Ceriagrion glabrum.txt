I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be a mix-up in your information. The Common Citril is actually a type of bird, not an insect. The scientific name you provided, Ceriagrion glabrum, refers to a species of damselfly, not the Common Citril. 

If you're asking about the damselfly Ceriagrion glabrum, here are some characteristics:

Insect with a slender body.
Insect with a long, thin abdomen.
Insect with two pairs of wings that are typically held together over the body when at rest.
Insect with large, compound eyes.
Insect with a bright, often metallic or iridescent coloration.
Insect that is usually found near water bodies as they lay their eggs in water.
Insect with an aquatic larval stage, known as a nymph.
Insect with a carnivorous diet, feeding on small insects, spiders, or other small aquatic organisms.

If you're asking about the bird Common Citril (Serinus citrinella), here are some characteristics:

Bird with a bright yellow-green body.
Bird with a streaked back and wings.
Bird with a small, conical bill.
Bird that is often found in mountainous regions.
Bird that feeds primarily on seeds.
Bird with a sweet, twittering song.

Please clarify if you need information about the damselfly or the bird.
