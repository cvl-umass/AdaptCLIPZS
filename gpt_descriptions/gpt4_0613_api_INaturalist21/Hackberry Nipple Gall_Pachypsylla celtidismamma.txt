The insect is associated with a gall, which is a growth on a plant that the insect induces for its own use.
The gall is typically found on hackberry trees, hence the name Hackberry Nipple Gall.
The gall itself is a small, round, and hard structure that protrudes from the leaf surface.
The gall is often green or yellow in color, matching the color of the hackberry leaf.
The gall has a distinctive nipple-like protrusion at the top, which gives the insect its name.
The insect inside the gall is a type of psyllid, a small, jumping insect that is often mistaken for a tiny cicada.
The psyllid is typically less than 1/8 inch long, making it difficult to see without magnification.
The psyllid has clear wings that are held roof-like over the body when at rest.
The psyllid has a distinctive head shape, with the eyes and antennae located on the sides of the head.
The psyllid has a short, stout body, with the abdomen often wider than the rest of the body.
The psyllid is typically a pale yellow or green color, which helps it blend in with the gall and the leaf.
The psyllid is typically found in North America, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the continent.
The psyllid is most commonly seen in the late summer and fall, when the galls are most prominent on the hackberry leaves.
The psyllid is often found in large numbers, with multiple galls on a single leaf or branch.
The psyllid is not harmful to the hackberry tree, but the galls can be unsightly and are often a sign of a large psyllid population.
