I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The term "Excultanus excultus" does not appear to correspond to any known species of insect. It's possible that there may be a spelling error or the name could be outdated or incorrect. Please provide the correct name or more information so I can give you an accurate response.
