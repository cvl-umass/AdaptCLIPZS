The plant has a cylindrical shape, often appearing as a single stem or in clusters.
The plant is small to medium in size, typically not exceeding 10 inches in height.
The plant has a green to bluish-green color, which can help it blend into its desert surroundings.
The plant is covered in spines, which are often multicolored, giving it the name "rainbow hedgehog cactus".
The spines are arranged in a radial pattern around the cactus, with each areole (a small round area on the cactus where the spines grow) having about 20 spines.
The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of pink, red, or purple.
The flowers are large in relation to the size of the cactus, often covering the top of the plant.
The plant produces small, round fruits that are red or pink in color.
The plant is typically found in arid desert environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soil.
The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, so a photo taken in these regions could potentially be of a rainbow hedgehog cactus.
The plant is often found growing in full sun, as it is highly tolerant of heat and drought.
The plant has a slow growth rate, often taking several years to reach its full size.
The plant is often found growing alone, but it can also form clusters with other cacti.
The plant has a distinctive round, barrel-like shape, which can help distinguish it from other types of cacti.
The plant's spines are not only multicolored but also dense and long, providing a protective barrier against predators.
