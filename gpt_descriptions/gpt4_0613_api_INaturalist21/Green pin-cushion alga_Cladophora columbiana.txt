The plant's spherical shape and uniform color distinguish it from other types of algae.
The plant's cilia can be seen moving in the water, giving it a shimmering appearance.
The plant's surface may appear slightly bumpy or uneven due to the presence of cilia.
The plant's size and shape can vary depending on environmental conditions, but it generally maintains a spherical form.
The plant's bright green color is due to the presence of chlorophyll, which it uses for photosynthesis.
The plant's habitat can provide clues to its identity, as it prefers calm, nutrient-rich waters.
