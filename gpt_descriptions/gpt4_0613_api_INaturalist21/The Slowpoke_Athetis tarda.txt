I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be a mix-up. The Slowpoke, or Athetis tarda, is not an insect but a species of moth in the family Noctuidae. Here are some characteristics that can help identify this moth:

Insect with a wingspan of 27-32 mm, which is a typical size for moths in the Noctuidae family.
Insect with forewings that are pale brownish-grey in color.
Insect with a distinct dark brown band along the outer margin of the forewings.
Insect with hindwings that are greyish-white in color.
Insect with a body that is covered in fine, hair-like scales, typical of moths.
Insect with antennae that are thread-like and not clubbed at the end, which is a characteristic of moths.
Insect with a nocturnal lifestyle, as suggested by its family name Noctuidae, meaning 'night'.
Insect that is attracted to light, which is a common behavior among moths.
Insect that can be found in habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and open woodland, which are typical habitats for many moth species.
Insect that is native to Europe, as Athetis tarda is known to be found in this region.
Insect with larvae that feed on various grasses, which is a common feeding habit of moth caterpillars.
Insect with a flight period that is typically from July to August, which is a common flight period for many moth species in temperate regions.
