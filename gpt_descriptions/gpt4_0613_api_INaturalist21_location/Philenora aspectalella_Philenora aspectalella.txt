I'm sorry, but there seems to be very limited information available on the specific habitats and geographical locations of the insect Philenora aspectalella. This might be due to the fact that it's not a well-studied species. However, as a general rule, many insects of the same family (in this case, the Gelechiidae family) can be found in various environments worldwide, from forests to grasslands and human settlements.
