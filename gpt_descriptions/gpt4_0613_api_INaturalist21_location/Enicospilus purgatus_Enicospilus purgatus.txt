I'm sorry, but there's very limited information available on the specific habitats of the Enicospilus purgatus. This species is a type of parasitic wasp and members of the genus Enicospilus are generally found worldwide. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to provide a detailed description of the habitats and geographical locations for this particular species.
