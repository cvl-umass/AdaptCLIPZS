I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The Slowpoke, or Athetis tarda, is not an insect. It's actually a species of moth in the family Noctuidae. However, there is no specific information available about its habitat or geographical location. It's possible that it might be found in various environments where moths typically live, such as in forests, meadows, and gardens, but without more specific information, it's hard to say for sure.
