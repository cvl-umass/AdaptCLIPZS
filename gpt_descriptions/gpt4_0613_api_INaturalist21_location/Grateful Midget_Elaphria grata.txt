I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The Elaphria grata, also known as the Grateful Midget, is not an insect but a species of moth in the family Noctuidae. However, I can provide information about its habitat and geographical location:

"An organism which is primarily found in North America, specifically in the United States."
"A creature which inhabits woodland areas and suburban gardens."
"An organism which is nocturnal and is most active during the warmer months."
"A species which is attracted to light, often found near outdoor lighting fixtures."
"A creature which, in its larval stage, feeds on a variety of plants including willows and poplars."
"An organism which is most commonly seen from late spring to early fall."
"A species which, despite its name, is not particularly small, with a wingspan of up to 35 mm."
