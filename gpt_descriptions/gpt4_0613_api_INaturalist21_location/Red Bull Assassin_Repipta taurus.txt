I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The "Red Bull Assassin" or "Repipta taurus" does not appear to be a recognized species in entomology. It's possible that there may be a mix-up with the names. Could you please provide more details or check the name of the insect? I'd be happy to help with the correct information.
