I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The Ambiguous Moth, or Lascoria ambigualis, does not appear to exist in scientific literature. It's possible that the name was misspelled or miscommunicated. Could you please provide the correct name or more details about the insect you're interested in?
