I'm sorry, but there seems to be very limited information available on the specific habitat and geographical location of the insect Pantydia sparsa. This species might not have been studied extensively, or it could be rare or not well-documented. It's also possible that it's found in a variety of habitats, making it difficult to provide a specific description. I recommend reaching out to an entomologist or a related expert for more detailed information.
