I'm sorry, but there seems to be very limited information available on the specific habitat and geographical location of the Hollow-spotted Blepharomastix (Blepharomastix ranalis). This insect might not be well-studied or it could be rare. I recommend reaching out to entomologists or biological research institutions for more detailed information.
