I'm sorry for the confusion, but the Common Citril is actually a bird, not an insect. Its scientific name is Serinus citrinella. However, Ceriagrion glabrum is a species of damselfly. I'll provide information for both.

For the Common Citril (Serinus citrinella):
"A bird which is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Alps and Pyrenees."
"A bird which prefers habitats of open woodland and forest edges."
"A bird which can also be found in gardens and orchards, especially in areas with coniferous trees."
"A bird which is often seen in high-altitude meadows during the breeding season."

For the Ceriagrion glabrum:
"An insect which is widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa."
"An insect which prefers habitats near still or slow-flowing water bodies, such as ponds, lakes, and marshes."
"An insect which can also be found in man-made habitats like rice fields and reservoirs."
"An insect which is often seen in areas with abundant vegetation, both submerged and emergent."
