I'm sorry, but there seems to be very limited information available on the specific habitat and geographical location of the insect Eremnophila aureonotata. This might be due to the fact that it's not a well-studied species. However, Eremnophila species in general are known to inhabit desert and arid regions. Here are some general descriptions based on that:

"An insect which thrives in desert and arid regions."
"An insect which is adapted to survive in harsh, dry climates."
"An insect which can be found in regions with sparse vegetation."
"An insect which is typically found in sandy or rocky environments."
"An insect which is often found in regions with extreme temperature fluctuations."

Please note that these descriptions are based on the general characteristics of the Eremnophila genus and may not be entirely accurate for Eremnophila aureonotata.
