I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The Brown Scoopwing, or Calledapteryx dryopterata, doesn't appear to be a recognized species in entomology. It's possible that the name is misspelled, or it could be a very obscure or newly discovered species that isn't widely documented yet. Could you please provide more information or check the name of the insect?
