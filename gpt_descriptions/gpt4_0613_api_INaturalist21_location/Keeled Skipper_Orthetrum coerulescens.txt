I'm sorry, but there seems to be a mix-up in your information. The Orthetrum coerulescens is actually a type of dragonfly, commonly known as the Keeled Skimmer, not a skipper. Here is the correct information about its habitat and geographical location:

An insect which is commonly found in Western Europe, from Ireland in the west, to Finland and Russia in the east.
An insect which prefers habitats like heathland, moorland, and sometimes coastal marshes.
An insect which is often seen around shallow, acidic pools and lakes.
An insect which can also be found in parts of North Africa and Asia.
An insect which is typically seen from June to September, with peak sightings in July.
An insect which is known to be territorial, often seen perched on vegetation or the ground.
An insect which is blue in males and yellow-brown in females, making it easier to spot in its natural habitat.
An insect which is known to be a strong flier, often seen patrolling its territory.
An insect which is not typically found in heavily forested or urban areas.
An insect which is more likely to be found in open, sunny areas with plenty of water bodies.
