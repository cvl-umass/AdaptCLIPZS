I'm sorry, but there seems to be limited information available on the specific habitat and geographical location of the plant Leonurus quinquelobatus. It's possible that this plant is not widely studied or it may be known under a different name. I recommend consulting a botanist or a plant taxonomy expert for more accurate information.
