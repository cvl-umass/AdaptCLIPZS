I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The White-bowed Smoothwing or Scaeva affinis is not a recognized species in entomology. It's possible that the name is misspelled or incorrect. Could you please provide the correct name or more details about the insect? I'd be happy to help you find the information you're looking for.
