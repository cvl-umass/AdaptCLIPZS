I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. Bulia deducta, also known as the Deduced Graphic, is not an insect but a species of moth. Here is the correct information:

"An insect which is actually a moth species that belongs to the family Noctuidae."
"An insect which is native to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada."
"An insect which can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and suburban areas."
"An insect which is nocturnal and is most active during the night."
"An insect which is attracted to light, making it commonly found near outdoor lighting."
"An insect which has a wingspan of 35-40 mm, with a distinct pattern on its wings."
"An insect which has a single generation per year, with adults usually seen from July to September."
"An insect which feeds on a variety of plants, including willow and poplar."
