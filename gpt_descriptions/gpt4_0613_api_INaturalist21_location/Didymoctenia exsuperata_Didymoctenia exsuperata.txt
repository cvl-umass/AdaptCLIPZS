I'm sorry, but there seems to be very limited information available on the specific habitats and geographical locations of the insect Didymoctenia exsuperata. This might be due to the fact that it's not a well-studied species. However, I'll provide you with the general information that is typically associated with insects of the same family (Geometridae):

"An insect which is commonly found in diverse environments such as forests, meadows, and gardens."
"An insect which can be located in both tropical and temperate regions."
"An insect which is often attracted to light, making it more visible at night."
"An insect which, as a caterpillar, is typically found on the underside of leaves where it feeds and grows."
"An insect which can be found in regions with a high abundance of host plants for its larvae."
"An insect which, during its pupal stage, can often be found in leaf litter or just below the soil surface."

Please note that these are general characteristics of the Geometridae family and may not apply specifically to Didymoctenia exsuperata. For more accurate information, it would be best to consult a specialist or entomologist.
