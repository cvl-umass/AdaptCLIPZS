I'm sorry, but there seems to be very limited information available on the specific habitats of the Chrysis angolensis. This species is part of the Chrysididae family, also known as cuckoo wasps, which are generally found in diverse habitats worldwide. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to provide a detailed description of the habitats for this particular species.
