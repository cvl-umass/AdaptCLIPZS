I'm sorry, but there seems to be very limited information available on the specific habitat and geographical location of the insect Analeptura lineola. It's possible that it might not be a well-studied or widely recognized species. I recommend consulting a specialized entomologist or a comprehensive entomological database for more detailed information.
