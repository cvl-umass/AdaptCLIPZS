I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The Dimorphic Macalla Moth, or Epipaschia superatalis, doesn't appear to be a recognized species in scientific literature. It's possible that the name is misspelled, or it could be a very obscure species. Could you please provide more information or check the name of the species?
