I'm sorry, but there seems to be very limited information available on the specific habitats of the insect Culladia cuneiferellus. This species might not have been studied extensively, or it could be rare or difficult to locate. It's also possible that it's found in a variety of habitats, making it hard to provide specific details. I recommend reaching out to entomologists or biological researchers for more detailed information.
